      <h3> An honest system for truckers and customers to charge each other</h3>

      <p>
        Currently one the major issues in the trucking industry is that customer are asking truckers
        for a service and the truckers often do not know how to charge for those services and are
        unable to charge in a timely manner. This results in lost income for the truckers, who are helping
        transport things that we use and buy from stores every day. Honest Quotes is place where
        truckers can go and find the right price for a job quickly and easily. There are two
        features of Honest Quotes that helps truckers get fair rates.
